# Contributing

## How-To

There are two ways to contribute:

- Submit a change request on Gitbook
- Submit a pull request on Github

## Banned content

Do not add any of the following in a Pull Request or risk getting the PR closed:

- Any sort of griefing resource (ban evading, server-crashing exploits, etc.). If you want to report a bug do so in the appropriate codebase.
- National Socialist Party of Germany content, National Socialist Party of Germany related content, or National Socialist Party of Germany references
- Anything which violates GitHub's [terms of service](https://github.com/site/terms).

Just because something isn't on this list doesn't mean that it's acceptable. Use common sense above all else.
