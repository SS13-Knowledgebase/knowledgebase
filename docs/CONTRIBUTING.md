# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the knowledgebase, you can either do so via the GitHub, which, while being harder to edit, is a lot easier to access, or in Gitbook via the links below.

Do note that you need to join each space via a link to gain editorial access, in which you can perform a change request. Otherwise, they won't show up in the "Knowledgebase" collection when trying to edit.

## Banned content

Do not add any of the following in a Pull Request or risk getting the PR closed:

- Any sort of griefing resource (ban evading, server-crashing exploits, etc.). If you want to report a bug do so in the appropriate codebase.
- National Socialist Party of Germany content, National Socialist Party of Germany related content, or National Socialist Party of Germany references
- Anything which violates GitHub's [terms of service](https://github.com/site/terms) or Gitbook's [terms of service](https://policies.gitbook.com/terms)

Just because something isn't on this list doesn't mean that it's acceptable. Use common sense above all else.
