# How to Make a Turbine from Scratch

So, you’re probably reading this because you just tried, for an hour, to figure out how to make the turbine actually work.

Well, you’re in luck.

So, I’m going to assume you already know how a turbine works.

You’re going to want to build something like this:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

The big black box is the burn chamber; **You want the flooring to be reinforced in there.**\
****The 4 green circles are scrubbers, set to scrub everything except **tritium, oxygen, & plasma**.\
This is to ensure we get the pressure and heat desired, without having other gasses interfere.\
The brown pipes leading out is where the scrubbed gasses will go.\
You can make lots of filters where they end to separate the gasses to your liking, and store them.\
****![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>) The turbine.

The 2 red boxes, labeled **1** & **2** are where the turbine parts will go. **1** is where the small part goes, while **2** is where the large, thruster-like part goes.

Imagine the top part of this picture is where the burn chamber is and the bottom part is where waste/space is.

The pink box is where space/waste is. You can set a scrubber in there to siphon and have it go into the waste loop.

The orange box in the middle of the burn chamber is where the injector is located. This will inject a burn mix into the chamber.

I suggest **dropping some lighters on top of each scrubber** in there, so it will always ignite whenever more fuel is added.

The mixer, with an orange pipe and yellow pipe connected to it, is what sets the burn mix. In the blue box, you want to setup an o2 farm with smoke machines and such. Refer on how to make an o2 farm using smoke machines and synthesizers.

In the yellow box, you want to setup a plasma farm. Again, refer to the plasma farm using tanks and synthesizers.

You want to place cables under each part of the turbines. Then you want to install the turbines. They’ll most likely be facing in the wrong direction, so you can screw and wrench to change direction. Then screw maint closed. Then screw and wrench the other one.

You then want to hook the cables up to a console which has the turbine circuit installed, and also hook the cable to a SMES or wherever you want it to output. Check the console. If it says one isn’t connected, screw the part, then spam the wrench 4 times, so it makes a 360. Do the same for the other part, and they should find each other.

That’s it. Now you got power production for an indefinite, infinite amount of time.
