# How to Create Infinite Gas

In this guide, I will go over the steps needed to create infinite plasma, oxygen, nitrogen, and more!

The idea behind it is pretty simple. Using synthesizers (plumbing), we can pump infinite chemicals into a tank, and make reactions happen.

You can also stack the machines on top of each other for more chemicals.

For plasma, you can create **phlogiston** in the tank, using **Phosphorus**, **Sulphuric Acid**, and **Stable Plasma**.

You want to have the tank in an air-tight 1x1, like by using directional windows, and make sure the chamber contains nothing (0kPa). Next up, you just pump the chemicals into the tank, and they’ll react to create plasma.

SA, SP, and PHO are the ingredients for plasma. In a tank, it’ll create Phlogiston, or Phlog, for short, and get vented into whatever system you have.

The passive vent in there will equalize the amount of kPa with whatever it’s connected to. You could connect it to a connector, and slap on a canister, to harvest the gasses in a portable form.

If you want to make nitrogen or oxygen, you’ll need to transform liquid into gas. How do you do that, you ask? You swap out the tank with a smoke machine.

You can rotate a smoke machine by dragging it. Make sure to align the smoke machine with your plumbing, then wrench it in place. It’ll then turn liquid oxygen into oxygen, and liquid nitrogen into nitrogen, etc.

Do note that more tiles = more gas, when it comes to smoke machines. Simply changing the range doesn't output more gas. Check local code for specifics.
